# Roadmap

## In the next few weeks

* The auth backend `none` will be updated to disallow direct connection (only by the root user or a brick for example)
* Remove metadata from the meeting
* Allows to switch a meeting to be writable or readonly
* Create meeting metadata will be stored in events metadata (internal.meeting.add)

## Later

* Better user API for update
* WebSocket API (need some work on yaws)
* Delete a meeting (clean all events and roles associated to this meeting)
* Rename `meeting` to `channel`
