# Introduction

## Technology agnostic

You can build your applications with your preferred language. We currently support Erlang, Ruby and javascript. See [[javascript|ucejs]] and [[ruby|ruby_install]] api.

## Brick

A brick is a daemon that speak HTTP with U.C.Engine. It's the easiest way to integrate existing applications with U.C.Engine. See [[ReST API|api]].

## Event

U.C.Engine event is the language to create your application. Some events are triggered by U.C.Engine but you can also create your own events without any configuration. Just create it.

With events you are creating you own protocol. The logic is delegated to the client.

## Meeting

A meeting is a place where events are broadcasted.

In an application you can create meetings a much as you like.
